These homework assignments are part of Reichman University's "System Programming in C (CS3144)" course. The course provides an introduction to procedural programming in a UNIX/Linux environment and covers:

- **C Programming Fundamentals:** Understanding memory structure, memory management, pointers, and the design of procedural programs.
- **Linux Environment Skills:** Managing permissions, working with text files, and writing shell scripts.
- **Programming Assignments:** Hands-on exercises that include file manipulation tasks, text parsing with piped sequences, writing shell scripts, and developing C programs that work with bit-level operations and custom data types.

This repository contains:
- Solutions to file management tasks using common Linux commands.
- Shell scripts that demonstrate text processing and recursive file operations.
- C programs that implement custom functions and data type manipulations.
